# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds configurable reminder notifications to help employees remember to clock in/out during their work schedule. The notification system will be disabled by default to respect user preferences and can be enabled through the application settings. This addresses the common issue of employees forgetting to track their time, which can lead to incomplete timesheets and administrative overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to receive optional reminder notifications to clock in/out, so that I don't forget to track my work time accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is first installed THEN the notification reminders SHALL be disabled by default
2. WHEN I access the settings menu THEN I SHALL see an option to enable/disable clock reminder notifications
3. WHEN I enable clock reminder notifications THEN I SHALL be able to configure reminder times for clock in and clock out
4. WHEN a configured reminder time is reached THEN the system SHALL send a local notification reminding me to clock in or clock out
5. WHEN I tap on a reminder notification THEN the application SHALL open directly to the time tracking screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to customize my reminder notification schedule, so that the reminders align with my personal work schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable notifications THEN I SHALL be able to set a preferred clock-in reminder time (e.g., 8:00 AM)
2. WHEN I enable notifications THEN I SHALL be able to set a preferred clock-out reminder time (e.g., 5:00 PM)
3. WHEN I configure reminder times THEN I SHALL be able to choose which days of the week to receive reminders
4. WHEN I set reminder preferences THEN the system SHALL validate that clock-out time is after clock-in time
5. WHEN I disable notifications THEN all scheduled reminders SHALL be cancelled immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an employee, I want intelligent reminder notifications that consider my current clock status, so that I only receive relevant reminders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am already clocked in THEN I SHALL NOT receive a clock-in reminder notification
2. WHEN I am already clocked out THEN I SHALL NOT receive a clock-out reminder notification
3. WHEN I clock in manually THEN any pending clock-in reminder for that day SHALL be cancelled
4. WHEN I clock out manually THEN any pending clock-out reminder for that day SHALL be cancelled
5. WHEN it's a weekend or holiday THEN I SHALL NOT receive reminder notifications unless specifically configured

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an employee, I want to manage notification permissions properly, so that the reminder system works reliably on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first enable notifications THEN the system SHALL request notification permissions from the device
2. WHEN notification permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL show a clear message explaining how to enable them in device settings
3. WHEN notification permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL confirm that reminders are now active
4. WHEN the app is in the background THEN reminder notifications SHALL still be delivered at the scheduled times
5. WHEN I revoke notification permissions at the device level THEN the app SHALL detect this and update the settings UI accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an employee, I want reminder notifications to be respectful and non-intrusive, so that they help without being annoying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reminder notification is sent THEN it SHALL use a gentle, professional tone
2. WHEN a reminder notification is displayed THEN it SHALL include the current time and the action needed (clock in/out)
3. WHEN I dismiss a reminder notification THEN it SHALL not repeat for that specific time slot
4. WHEN I snooze a reminder notification THEN it SHALL remind me again after 15 minutes (maximum 2 snoozes per reminder)
5. WHEN multiple reminders are pending THEN they SHALL be grouped to avoid notification spam
